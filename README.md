>As Gojo started to levitate in front of the eyes of Toji he says:
>### _**"Throughout Heaven and Earth, i alone, am the honored one"**_
>
>[_If i am with you starts playing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hkI43oPIxk)
>
>
>He's high... Toji, The Sorcerer Killer murmured
>
>You're from the Zen'in clan right? Gojo spoke
>You may know about the Limitless and the Six Eyes of the Gojo Clan.
>However, only a few know about this technique.
>
>_Take the amplified and the reversal, then smash together those two expressions of infinity to create and push out imaginary mass._

>As Gojo's yet strongest technique, Purple, erased throught everything on its path, including a massive part of Toji's torso.
